Setup for Unity
***************

Let's setup the Alexa Plus SDK for Unity!

Prerequisites
=============

-  `Unity <https://unity3d.com/>`_ version 4.x or above.
-  Configure AWS and PubNub as explained `in configuration <https://alexaplusunity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GS-Configuration.html>`_.

Integrating the Games SDK for Alexa into your Unity project
============================================================

1. Download Games SDK for Alexa from the `Unity Asset Store <http://u3d.as/1kfP>`_.
2. Add the asset package to your Unity project.
3. Make sure everything is checked and click **Import**.

That's it! However, in order to handle the communication to and from Alexa, you need to create your own script to initalize the manager. See a Tutorial for a more in-depth implementation.
