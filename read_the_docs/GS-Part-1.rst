Setup for Unity

Let's setup the Alexa Plus SDK for Unity!

Prerequisites
=============

-  `Unity <https://unity3d.com/>`_ version 4.x or above.
-  Configure AWS as explained `here <https://alexaplusunity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/AWS-SetUp.html<`_.

Integrating the Alexa Plus Unity SDK into your Unity project
============================================================

1. Download the ``AlexaPlusUnity.unitypackage`` from the `Releases <https://github.com/AustinMathuw/AlexaPlusUnity/releases>`_ tab in the GitHub project.
2. Open your project in Unity.
3. Open your newly downloaded ``AlexaPlusUnity.unitypackage`` and import the package.

That's it! However, in order to handle the communication to and from Alexa, you need to create your own script to initalize the manager. See a Tutorial for a more in-depth implementation.
